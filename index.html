						<h1>Hi Class</h1>
				<p>This is Kevin Hudson. I was able to successfully link GitHub account to</p>
				<p>The new domain site that I bought. I chose to go with kevinhudson101.com </p>
				<p>for several reasons: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>My name has already been taken but not displaying on the web.</li>
			<li>I wanted a .COM so I wouldnâ€™t settle for less.</li>
			<li>I selected kevinhudson101 like a college class 101. </li>
			<li>kevinhudson101 would be the "basic" overview of myself, my portfolio. </li>
			<li>Lastly, I am not skilled yet in making the best decisions. </li>
		</ul>
